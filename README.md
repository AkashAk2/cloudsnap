Serverless Image Storage System with Tagging (2023)

CloudSnap is a collaborative endeavor by our team to create a serverless image storage system with tagging capabilities. The project facilitates seamless image uploading, automatic tagging, and user-friendly querying based on detected objects. Developed as part of a group assignment, CloudSnap demonstrates our collective effort in building a cloud-based solution using AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito), Yolo, Python, RESTful APIs, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
